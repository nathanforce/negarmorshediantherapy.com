I just really wanted to take the time to tell you guys about my amazing boyfriend James.  Where do I even start? My favorite thing about James is probably just simply how cool he is.  He is the epitome of cool.  Look at this picture below. He looks like a soccer star!! Amazing.  Another thing that I like about James is that he is such a great friend.  When I witness him spending time with his best friend, Nathan, who is also fucking insanely awesome I just can't even handle it! They are so adorable and man friends.
