I am a New York State Licensed Mental health Counselor. I earned an advanced Master's Degree in Counseling Psychology from Columbia University and a Bachelor's Degree in Biopsychology from the University of British Columbia. In addition to my practice, I work as a therapist, supervisor, and program coordinator at Kull Initiative for Psychotherapy. Formerly, I worked as a family therapist with the New York Foundling.
