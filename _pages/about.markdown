I am a New York State Licensed Mental health Counselor. I earned an advanced Master's Degree in Psychological Counseling from Columbia University and a Bachelor's Degree in Biopsychology from the University of British Columbia. In addition to my practice, I work as a therapist, supervisor, and program coordinator at Kull Initiative for Psychotherapy (KIP). Formerly, I worked as a family therapist with the New York Foundling. 

As an Iranian-Canadian woman of color, I have learned to pay special attention to cultural context and intersections of identity. I am passionate about working with individuals from marginalized populations. I am experienced in working with LGBTQ adults and adolescents.
